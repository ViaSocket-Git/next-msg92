In todayâ€™s world, the demand for application interfaces that provide connectivity between two applications is increasing, and here comes the concept of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API acts as an intermediary between the applications and comes into the role because everything is done digitally through apps.

So, APIs provide an interface for two applications to interact with each other. This helps extract and share data within and across the organizations. APIs increase connectivity between two software, which further enhances the user experience.

For instance, we use a mode of payment on any payment app to book flight tickets, so there is an API that helps connect both the applications, i.e., the payment app and the airline app from which we want to book a flight.
